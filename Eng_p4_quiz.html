    <h4><u>Title: The Day the Pencil Ran Away!</u></h4>
    <p>
      One morning, Tom was ready to start his test. He opened his pencil case, but—Oh no! His pencil was gone!
      <br><br>
      “Where is my pencil?” Tom asked. He looked under his book, inside his bag, and even in his shoe! But it was nowhere to be found.
      <br><br>
      Suddenly, he heard a tiny voice whisper, “I’m tired of writing! I need a break!”
      <br><br>
      Tom jumped. Was his pencil talking?
      <br><br>
      The pencil rolled off the table and hid under the teacher’s desk.
      <br><br>
      Tom laughed. “Come back, Pencil! If you help me finish my test, I will give you a long rest!”
      <br><br>
      The pencil thought for a moment and then rolled back to Tom.
      <br><br>
      “Okay, but no chewing on me this time!” it said.
      <br><br>
      Tom smiled and started his test.
